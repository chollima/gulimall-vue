# gulimall-vue

- Gulimall-vue is developed based on renren-fast-vue, and the project is constructed by vue and element-ui to realize the front-end functions of the [gulimall](https://gitee.com/chollima_zhou/gulimall) background management system.
- The front and back ends are separated, and data interaction is performed through tokens, which can be deployed independently.
- Theme Customization: unified one-stop customization through SCSS variables.
- Dynamic menu: unified management of access routes through menu management.
- Data switching: switch interface data/mock simulation data through mock configuration.
